        <h3>Give Thanks To The Lord, For He.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Our heavenly father showers us with numerous blessings, and the holy scripture assures us that his gifts never run out. This is also a blessing to. Using the bible verses about.</p>
        <h3>“For He Will Command His Angels Concerning You To Guard You In All Your Ways.”.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I pray to god to bless you with peace and happiness. “i thank my god in all my remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy. May this day be filled with happiness and peace.</p>
        <h3>“From Birth, I Was Cast On You;</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>For you have possessed my reins:. The lord lift up his. I will sing the praises of your name, o most.</p>
        <h3>I Will Be Glad And Rejoice In You;</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This verse is about the blessings that we have from the lord and can remind others of the blessings they receive today and every day. Five years is the age for the study of scripture, ten is the age for the study of mishnah, thirteen is the age for observing. Growing older may not always feel like a blessing, but god’s beneficent.</p>
        <h3>Take Delight In The Lord, And He Will Give You The Desires Of Your Heart.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Sending someone a birthday card with the wisdom of the scriptures is the best way to wish someone a “happy birthday”. I will tell of all your wonderful deeds. Dear god, i want to thank you for my birthday today.</p>
